There are no official hand-written ([L2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_lib)) constructs for this service yet. Here are some suggestions on how to proceed:

- Search [Construct Hub for MediaPackage construct libraries](https://constructs.dev/search?q=mediapackage)
- Use the automatically generated [L1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_l1_using) constructs, in the same way you would use [the CloudFormation AWS::MediaPackage resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_MediaPackage.html) directly.


(Read the [CDK Contributing Guide](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in contributing to this construct library.)

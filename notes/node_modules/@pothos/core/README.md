# Pothos GraphQL

Pothos is a plugin based GraphQL schema builder for typescript.

It makes building graphql schemas in typescript easy, fast and enjoyable. The core of Pothos adds 0
overhead at runtime, and has `graphql` as its only dependency.

Pothos is the most type-safe way to build GraphQL schemas in typescript, and by leveraging type
inference and typescript's powerful type system Pothos requires very few manual type definitions and
no code generation.

Pothos has a unique and powerful plugin system that makes every plugin feel like its features are
built into the core library. Plugins can extend almost any part of the API by adding new options or
methods that can take full advantage of the Pothos type system.

## Hello, World

```typescript
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node';
import SchemaBuilder from '@pothos/core';

const builder = new SchemaBuilder({});

builder.queryType({
  fields: (t) => ({
    hello: t.string({
      args: {
        name: t.arg.string(),
      },
      resolve: (parent, { name }) => `hello, ${name || 'World'}`,
    }),
  }),
});

const server = createServer({
  schema: builder.toSchema({}),
});

server.start();
```

## What sets Pothos apart

- Pothos was built from the start to leverage typescript for best-in-class type-safety.
- Pothos has a clear separation between the shape of your external GraphQL API, and the internal
  representation of your data.
- Pothos comes with a large plugin ecosystem that provides a wide variety of features while
  maintaining great interoperability between plugins.
- Pothos does not depend on code-generation or experimental decorators for type-safety.
- Pothos has been designed to work at every scale from small prototypes to huge Enterprise
  applications, and is in use at some of the largest tech companies including Airbnb and Netflix.
